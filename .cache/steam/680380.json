It's a game that loops around and around inside my head when I'm not playing, the car endlessly circling the block, never stopping, while that plane jets overhead, lights blinking”<br>Recommended – Eurogamer<br><br>“...what is most striking about Night Call is the phenomenal realism of the interactions with the lives of the various passengers.
