Feed on your disciples. Cultist Simulator is a game of apocalypse and yearning. Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories.","supported_languages":"English, Simplified Chinese, Russian, German, Japanese, French, Spanish - Spain","reviews":"“A magnificent nightmare, for those with the stamina to master the gruelling card game that houses it.”<br>Recommended – Eurogamer<br><br>“Cultist Simulator is something else. It’s seductive. It captures the looming threat of utter annihilation played against the transcendent bliss of unravelling mysteries wrapped in enigmas wrapped in other really, really weird shit. It’s excellent, put simply. The cosmic horror and occult subject matter isn’t just set dressing here – it’s expertly woven into the core of play, and the result is completely absorbing.”<br>Recommended – Rock, Paper, Shotgun<br><br>“Hauntingly rapturous to play and replay, Cultist Simulator won't let you be the next Jim Jones, but it might just make you the next Torgo. With sassier hair, naturally.”<br>90/100 –
