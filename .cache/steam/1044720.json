Grow 19 types of food, including forage items, fish and game, plus 12 food crops, each with different characteristics. Produce 32 crafted items and materials in a multi-tiered economy.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Build and Advance</strong> - Construct over 190 different buildings as you grow your town from a fledgling settlement to a bustling city. Your town center and housing will advance through multiple building tiers as the prosperity and desirability of your town increases and advancements are made in a vast 140+ point Tech Tree. Upgrade production buildings to increase efficiency and enable production of more advanced items.

Cultivate your fields over time, removing weeds and rocks, raising fertility and adjusting soil mixture to achieve maximum crop production to keep your growing population fed.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Advanced Town Simulation</strong> - Villagers actively live their lives and perform their jobs in real time. Watch as villagers carry goods across town from remote work-sites to be processed into materials and crafted into items. See foods and goods delivered to homes, the trade post or stored for later use. Develop roads, transport wagons and improve storage methods to facilitate the efficient movement of goods through your town and prevent spoilage.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Randomly Generated Maps</strong> - No game is ever quite the same with beautiful, completely randomized terrain generation and resource distribution.

Enable custom game options to cater the experience to your desires.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Environmental Interaction</strong> - Develop your economy based on which resources are locally abundant and produce items for trade to acquire that which you lack. Erect fencing to keep deer away from crop fields and stop bears from raiding food storage. Manage tree cover to prevent underground water supplies from drying up. Balance the need to clear land for agriculture around vital natural resources like wild growing medicinal plants and forage items.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>All Them Old-Timey Diseases!</strong> - Ensure your villagers have clean water to stop outbreaks of dysentery and cholera. Collect berries and plant greens to avoid scurvy and ensure a healthy diet. Make sure villagers are properly shoed and clothed to reduce chances of contracting tetanus, rabies or frostbite. Build a healer’s house to quarantine the infected and provide herbs and medicine for treatment. Manage rodent populations by collecting waste, securely storing food and employing rat catchers to ward off the feared bubonic plague.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Fend Off Would-Be Invaders</strong> - Choose to play on pacifist and avoid combat altogether or engage with varying levels of raider difficulty to raise the stakes for your town’s survival.
