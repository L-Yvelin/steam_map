Inkulinati is a game of nuance and brain-sizzling challenge that will test even the most hardened strategists. And as every hardened armchair general knows, it all starts with your units, which we call Beasts. There are multiple deadly (and bizarre) <strong>Beasts</strong> to unlock. They all have their special individual skills, as well as class-specific abilities causing different effects.
