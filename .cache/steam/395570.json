Do take a look.”<br>Rock Paper Shotgun<br><br>“We Are the Dwarves paints a beautiful world and a challenging one, but one worth delving into regardless of dangers that await you. Scouting ahead and considering the options open to you makes for an experience that rewards more than it frustrates even if there is little sign of originality. Still, it’s not every day you get to play as an astronaut from another race.”<br>Gameranx<br><br>“Singular in focus, but sidestepping ennui with impressive variety in mission design, We Are The Dwarves is a surprise treat. I knew I would at least find it interesting from pre-release trailers, but never anticipated how much I would dig the entire package. A rich world, chunky and responsive combat, We Are The Dwarves doesn't, ahem, fall short in any area.”<br>Wargamer<br>","header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395570/e1c54ab138d88bc461fd52802f46d1af6779b94f/header.jpg?t=1759332291","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395570/68df9e1988db53f113f5266f8a9b28bb976e006e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1759332291","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395570/68df9e1988db53f113f5266f8a9b28bb976e006e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1759332291","website":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3098340/Shadow_of_the_Matrix/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul
