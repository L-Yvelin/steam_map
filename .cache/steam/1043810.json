Full details:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Developer commentary throughout the whole game</h2>With this enabled, you'll find tape recorders lying around the levels. Pick one up and listen to us discussing the thinking behind the level you're playing, the character your controlling, this moment in the story, or whatever else is relevant. See the trailer for a look at this in action.<br><br>There are 52 of these recordings to find, totaling over 3 hours of commentary, spread across the game's 15 hour campaign. They're a mix of designer/writer Tom Francis talking through his own thinking, and interviewing each other member of the team about their work. <br><br>We get into the reasoning behind design and story decisions, ideas we tried that didn't work out, the hardest challenges we had to solve, and get a little closer to understanding why this game took forever make.<br><br>And when you're tired of listening to us, you can throw the tape recorder at an enemy to deal 1 knockback.<br><br>Two notes to be aware of:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The commentary does contain spoilers, so it's not intended for a first playthrough - we can't really give full insight on the thinking behind something without referring to how it plays out later.<br></li><li>The commentary is audio only, no subtitles. Volume is independently adjustable.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The WIZ-TAC Outfits</h2>We made a little pack of cosmetic outfits to say thanks to folks who supported us most: either by buying the game in launch week, or getting this Special Edition. They look like this!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1043810/extras/f1854bbd6486c879e7a20db175476951.avif?t=1766081514\" width=614 height=278 /></span><br><br>They're not automatically granted to you at the start of the game - we think it feels kinda sleazy to have gifts heaped on your character in-game because of a purchasing decision you made out-of-game. Instead they're just added to the normal outfits menu, and unlocked the same way the rest of them are: by spending Confidence points. <br><br>And just like all the other outfits, they're purely cosmetic.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The full soundtrack</h2>2 hours and 10 minutes of original music over 47 tracks by composer Robert Arzola, in high quality mp3 format. This is integrated into Steam soundtrack system, as well as just being in a folder on disk.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Lost Demo</h2>Before we settled on the demo we eventually released, we tried an overly ambitious concept: after defeating the Traffic Warlock in the campaign, Jen and Zan would start glitching forwards in time, glimpsing future content. It culminates in a level where they get to decide both how much of their future they want to see, and also the difficulty of the encounter, by choosing when to seal doors that are spawning enemies and allies from deeper into the game. All while those characters announce their arrival by making meta commentaries on their role in the story or game design.<br><br>Shockingly, this proved too complicated and weird for new players to grasp in the space of two levels, so we ended up building something much simpler. But we think the bespoke levels for the complex version might be fun to play once you do know the game, so we're including them here.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Tactical Breach Wizards is a turn-based tactics game in which you lead a team of renegade wizards in kevlar, as they unravel a modern conspiracy plot and/or find the most stylish way to punch a Traffic Warlock through a 4th story window.<br><br>It's a story-driven campaign of about 14 hours, in which you...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Combo spells for satisfying results</h2>Each of your wizards has a unique set of abilities, from a straightforward lightning bolt to transforming into a rabid dog. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1043810/extras/66e5f9826352aea17e828fc8a7d6439d.poster.avif?t=1766081514\" width=614 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1043810/extras/66e5f9826352aea17e828fc8a7d6439d.webm?t=1766081514\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1043810/extras/66e5f9826352aea17e828fc8a7d6439d.mp4?t=1766081514\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Experiment freely, rewind your mistakes</h2>When you hit a tricky situation, try every wild idea you have - you can always rewind if it didn't pan out.
