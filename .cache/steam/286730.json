There's enough action in this box to make it more than worth the buy for any sim enthusiast who's been looking for the right copter to fly. Even if simulations aren't the bread and butter of your gaming collection, you may still want to give this one a shot. It offers up a lot of action to the arcade gamer looking for something a little different. Chances are you may very well be playing this thing well into World War III.”<br>8/10 – IGN<br><br>“While Gunship! has serious realism problems, it has absolutely gorgeous graphics. The terrain is particularly impressive, and it conveys a great sense of being airborne. In fact, the major reason that Gunship! should be considered a flight action game is that its strengths parallel those of a good first-person shooter: It looks pretty, and it's easy to blow things up. Therein lies the game's appeal: While hard-core pilots will groan at the oversimplified avionics, casual sim pilots will enjoy the &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; simplicity of the game, as well as the ability to make just about everything on the map explode. Even trees seem to be filled with some kind of combustible material; they vanish with an explosion when hit by cannon fire.”<br>6.7/10 – Gamespot<br>","header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286730/5cd19e8d5d79625ba4bfcf64028ac856268dc4e1/header.jpg?t=1766101940","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286730/056d45b15abbdbb4ba80c0a31bfed215c9202351/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1766101940","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286730/056d45b15abbdbb4ba80c0a31bfed215c9202351/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1766101940","website":"https://www.microprose.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows XP or higher<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium MMX 233 MHz or higher<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 32 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> SVGA video card with 2 MB video memory<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 7.0<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 150 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Sound card</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"© Atari Interactive, Inc.
