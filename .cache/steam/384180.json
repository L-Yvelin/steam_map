Content in this game is mostly implied and is not the focus of the game.\r\n\r\nTable Items\r\nSince poker is typically played by adults, we offer adult-themed items for the player to equip on the table. For example, weapons can be brandished at the table, and the player's avatar is able to interact with them, such as picking up brass knuckles, a knife, or a gun. The avatar will also pick up drink items, such as drinking from a beer bottle or a shot glass. There are no applied effects, such as the avatar getting drunk from drinking. The avatar can also pick up a cigar or cigarette and \"take a drag\" from it. Most of these interactions are random; the player cannot initiate them.\r\n\r\nAvatars\r\nNo Avatars are ever fighting with each other in any physical way. There are ways for the player to express themselves through emotes, such as a chip trick, a throat slit hand motion, or a happy dance, but none of them display blood, gore, or any other mature content.\r\n\r\nEnvironments\r\nThe overall theme of the game is playing Poker in a city called Prominence. There are some allusions to legally and illegally playing poker with the \"Affiliations.\" The player picks an affiliation and gets rewards for leveling them up, but not for doing any legal or illegal activities.\r\n\r\nThe Laundromat has some implied drug trafficking through open boxes with non-descript packages in them. The player again cannot interact with this; there is no dialogue calling it out, it's purely visual.\r\n\r\nMotherland Meats is a meat packaging facility that has the most direct display of mature content. There are clean hanging pig corpses in the freezer, a human-shaped bag in the freezer, some dried blood splatters, and NPCs that are working in the background. There is no in-your-face gore, actively dripping or spilling blood.\r\n\r\nSolo Mode Bosses\r\nThe Mayor character has a British accent and uses language that may be considered crude to address and taunt the player.
