If I had to play a single Roguelite Deckbuilder for the rest of my life, this is the one I'd settle on.”<br>Kacem &quot;Noxious&quot; Khilaji<br><br>“You can essentially turn your hand cards into mana at any time... which makes the game about planning as opposed to reacting. You're setting up and being rewarded for these satisfying loops - perimeter oscillations, if you will - and calculating them feels nourishing to the mind. It's just a very generous game that even in Early Access has a lot of great touches.”<br>Jerry &quot;Tycho&quot; Holkins - Penny
