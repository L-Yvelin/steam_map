On a minute-to-minute scale, it balances challenge and humor to make for a game that feels like a well-realized version of some long forgotten sci-fi TV show.”<br>Destructoid<br><br>“Halcyon 6 is a sumptuous video game stew. It’s got hints of XCOM, FTL, 4X space games, and JRPGs, plus gobs of humor and personality. I’ve taken to calling it 4XCOM for short. This feels like the sort of game that will keep me hooked for weeks.”<br>Kotaku<br><br>“Strategy, resource management, and RPG combat in one charming nostalgic package”<br>8.5 –
