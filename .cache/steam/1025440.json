Lead powerful heroes and mighty armies into battle in this critically acclaimed turn-based strategy milestone. Level up and train your units and guide them through a gripping story campaign to decide the fate of a world on the brink of destruction.","supported_languages":"English, German, Spanish - Spain, Simplified Chinese, French, Russian","reviews":"“And this is the very reason why I believe Fantasy General 2: Invasion has not only tremendous staying power, but the potential of a fulfilling future.”<br>9 – Turn Based Lovers<br><br>“Graphically, I found the game beautiful, the music even great (the main track has been remastered from the original). The dialogue text and story depth is completely sufficient for me. Even though the balance of the game is not perfect and the level of difficulty is so high that it just cannot be done without reloading and optimizing, I still recommend any lover of turn-based games to buy it. Otherwise, you'll miss one of the most challenging and gripping genre representatives of the year!”<br>9.0 – Gamersglobal<br><br>“Like its predecessor, Fantasy General 2 captivates from the first mission and even improves a lot of things from the original: The moral system is more transparent, the missions with their very different goals and many side locations are much more dynamic. I am moved to try everything to prevent my heroes and experienced units from perishingr. Again and again I am faced with risky decisions: Should I follow the fleeing enemy with my decimated troops? Or rather rest at the risk that the refugees will reform themselves? This is how to make a worthy, contemporary successor to a decades-old classic!”<br>86 – Gamestar<br>","header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/header.jpg?t=1745952562","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1745952562","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1745952562","website":"http://www.slitherine.com/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows 8, 10 (64 bit)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual Core CPU 2.5Ghz Intel Core I2xxx or equivalent AMD CPU<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> dx11 graphics card with dedicated 2 gb video memory<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2200 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> 1366x768 min resolution</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 (64 bit)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Quad Core CPU 2.5Ghz Intel Core I2xxx or AMD Zen<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GTX 1060 3gb / AMD RX470 4GB or higher<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2200 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> 1920x1080 recommended resolution</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"legal_notice":"©2019 Slitherine Ltd.
