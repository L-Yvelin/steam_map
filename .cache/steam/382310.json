Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment.<br><br>To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources. Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players. Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another’s goals at separate or simultaneous times. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/382310/extras/cb545ec14f8823159e5f069653227a11.poster.avif?t=1762409229\" width=614 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/382310/extras/cb545ec14f8823159e5f069653227a11.webm?t=1762409229\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/382310/extras/cb545ec14f8823159e5f069653227a11.mp4?t=1762409229\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/382310/extras/a76419bc71e5f6d1d6e2d9ffc47922d9.avif?t=1762409229\" width=615 height=90 /></span><br>All of the world’s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions.

Eco is a revelation ... It made me realize that games are actually crucial for understanding our relationship to all kinds of natural and man-made systems. The thing that gives me chills is that I think it is only in games that we can play with economic systems. And I walked away from my experience in Eco feeling like I learned so much even though we had no instructor. No one was connecting the dots for us.
