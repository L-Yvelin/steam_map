Every run, the game will create an intricate map of dungeons, hinting at foes to come and solutions for puzzles you’ll face.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Lots Of Bosses</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >During your adventure through the dungeons, you’ll regularly face off with one of over fifty possible bosses. These range from the Queen Ant, to the Balrog and, yes, several menacing Dragons. Some of these bosses can only be slain with the right weapons, so make sure not to miss those on the previous levels.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Uncover Secret Items</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In the spirit of roguelikes, the game does not tell you which potions will save you, and which will kill you.

Some of these are part of puzzles and solving those may reap great rewards. So, you may want to pick up and read the books you’ll see lying around. They may feature hints on how to solve a puzzle, even one a few levels deeper.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Weapons</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You’ll be able to equip two items and wield them both. In the darkest deeps you might want to hold a burning torch beside your axe. Bats tend to be killed easily from a distance by throwing daggers at them, so why not equip them in both slots? Or wield a whip, no better, the Flaming Whip you just plucked from that Balrog you managed to finally kill. Or… perhaps it’s best you start with a shield. A big, enchanted shield. Yes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Armor</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your starting armor may not seem like much, but that’s only because… well, because it IS not that much.

Or… equip the right cloak on go stealth…</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Wait, Stealth?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Yes, that is an option. You can go unnoticed for a long time and execute surprise attacks for added damage. Like everything in Unexplored, it’s up to you to weigh the rewards versus the risk. Because a surprise attack on a Necromancer may sound like a terrific idea, but it’ll probably survive your first strike, leaving you quite vulnerable in your cloak of cloth.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/506870/extras/5c8178cb1454b33e9898719ed545ceaa.webp?t=1727772003\" width=618 height=60 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Progression</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Unexplored features several kinds of progression for you and your character.
