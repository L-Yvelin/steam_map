It addresses the farce of employment with creativity and humour, two things no malignant narcissist with a modest cash injection could ever take from us. It also has one of the most anarchic, diverse combat systems of any roguelike, which rewards experimentation yet almost never thrusts you into runs that feel unfair due to bad weapon drops.”<br>9/10 – The Indie Game Website<br><br>“Going Under perfectly combines the Rogue-lite genre in an irreverent and sarcastic environment.”<br>8.5/10 – The Games Machine<br><br>“In all, Going Under is the type of game to go above and beyond in its quirky mannerisms, being unafraid to poke fun at both the real world it parodies and even itself. This is a game I highly recommend if any gamer has an appreciation for dungeon crawling, bright colors, or humor in sheer parody fashion.”<br>8.4/10 – Hooked Gamers<br>","header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154810/header.jpg?t=1766055115","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1766055115","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1766055115","website":"https://aggrocrab.com/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows 7 64-bit<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i3-2100 | AMD Phenom II X4 965<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTS 450, 1 GB | AMD Radeon R7 250, 1 GB<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 10<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> 16:9 recommended</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5-3470 | AMD FX-6300<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 960, 4 GB | AMD Radeon R9 380, 4 GB<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 4 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> 16:9 recommended</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X 10.7+<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.1 GHz or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Integrated graphics or better (2048 MB)<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"legal_notice":"Going Under is developed by Aggro Crab Games.
