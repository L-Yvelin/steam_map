Featuring three unique maps, 13 new animals, 10 new buildings, and five new biomes to transform the desolate into the flourishing. An improved animal system and a new photography mode give you more ways to interact with and appreciate the ecosystems you create.<br><br>The new arid maps offer striking environments and creative restoration puzzles, from vast grassland savannahs, to sublime deserts, and verdant acacia forests. Coax greenery from salt pans and riverbeds choked with alien vegetation on the edge of the Parched Dunes. Bridge a vast canyon, douse oil fires, and restore a cactus-filled desert using the remote-controlled ERW1N recycling bot on the Canyon Peaks. Clean up a former oil field, creating muddy watering holes for all manner of fauna, and bring diversity back to theFracked Floodplain.<br><br>To complement these dramatic landscapes, the wildlife system is more approachable and rewarding, with 13 new animals, including elephants, lions, crocodiles, and giraffes, that appear more naturally and stay longer. The new photography system lets you capture your favorite moments, earning stars for creative snapshots of happy animals and lush habitats, which you can keep in your trusty handbook<br><br>Deepen the sense of wonder and accomplishment at the heart of Terra Nil, as you bring life back to even the harshest places in Heatwave, the most significant and hottest content update to date.</p><br><h1>Terra Nil: Vita Nova</h1><p><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1593030/extras/768bb1a7c0bfa654d5e84befaf8f7898.avif?t=1756318967\" width=1080 height=348 /></span><br>Vita Nova expands on Terra Nil’s deeply satisfying nature restoration with new missions, buildings, an updated wildlife system, and a brand new world map—which is now fully 3D and can be freely rotated—giving you a more accurate and personalized overview of your efforts to bring life back to this dead world.<br><br>New levels include Polluted Bay, a barren landscape carved in half by a badly polluted river, and Scorched Caldera, a vast volcanic crater that you must transform into a life-filled freshwater lake. These, and all the new maps in the Vita Nova update, will put your reclamation skills to the test in interesting and unusual ways.<br><br>A completely overhauled wildlife system makes Terra Nil’s transformed landscapes more alive than ever. Animals emerge more naturally and have a deeper set of needs you need to fulfill if you want to keep them happy and abundant. This adds a new dimension of strategy to the game and gives you more animals to admire—including a brand new species, the jaguar—as nature is steadily restored.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1593030/extras/c35e47926a14771bc8be574ce5b6adf0.poster.avif?t=1756318967\" width=1080 height=380 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1593030/extras/c35e47926a14771bc8be574ce5b6adf0.webm?t=1756318967\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1593030/extras/c35e47926a14771bc8be574ce5b6adf0.mp4?t=1756318967\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Terra Nil is a game about transforming a barren, lifeless landscape into a thriving, vibrant ecosystem.
