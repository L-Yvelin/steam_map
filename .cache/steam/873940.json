Good design and battles that offer just enough tactical depth that even beginners can enjoy themselves.”<br>5/5 – Pixel Judge<br><br>“It is one of those titles I would fully recommend to any strategy fan with sci-fi tastes. It came out of nowhere, flying under my radar and sneakily placing itself in my 2019’s top 10 list.”<br>9,5/10 – Strategy Informer<br><br>“Crying Suns does right by its predecessors, all while carving out its own space in the genre. The sci-fi tactics game tosses you into the unknown with a need to find answers and a battleship to blast away the opposition. With solid mechanics and a superb story, it’s a good time waiting to be had.”<br>8/10 – Game Tyrant<br>","header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/873940/header.jpg?t=1727857441","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/873940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727857441","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/873940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727857441","website":"http://www.cryingsuns.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows 7+ (32/64 bits)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual-core 2.5 GHz or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Dedicated GPU, 1 GB VRAM/ AMD HD5750 or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 10<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Minimal resolution: 1280*720</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core i3 2,5 GHz or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Dedicated GPU, 2 GB VRAM / GTX 750ti or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 (Can go up to 5K@60FPS with high end gpu)</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> macOS 10.11 El Capitan<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual-core 2.5 GHz or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Dedicated GPU, 512 Mo VRAM / AMD HD5750 or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Mac with Intel Graphics (HD or Iris) should run the game in OpenGL mode to avoid potential issues.
