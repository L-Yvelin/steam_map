Our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong><u>50 BRAND NEW GAMES</u></strong> - These are NOT minigames or microgames!

Every game shares a unique 32-color palette and we took great efforts to make them look and sound like actual 8-bit titles from the 80s. On the other hand, it was important to us that UFO 50 was fun and surprising for modern players, so we chose not to limit ourselves to the genres and design conventions of the past.<br></li><li><strong><u>VERSUS AND CO-OP PLAY</u></strong> - Half of the collection features local multiplayer, including co-op and versus.
